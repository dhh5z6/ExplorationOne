# ExplorationOne
Recap
	In this exploration, I decided to do some research and experiment with the web development tool called Tachyons. Tachyons is a framework made up of numerous small modules that can be accessed and used by the user. The framework is used to easily create or modify a web pages CSS. In this exploration I used Tachyons to create a local web page on my machine. I did this because I ran into several problems when I tried to get the Tachyons to work in a live browser. However, I had no issues however running it in Brackets so I decided to do most of my experimenting in Brackets.
	To accomplish all that I did I just watched the 7 minute tutorial posted on the webpage at the following link.
	http://tachyons.io/
Upon completing the tutorial I just looked through there CSS library and messed around with formatting my web page. This was fairly simple to do after completing the tutorial video. If you would like to consider using Tachyons I would recommend watching the video and going from there.
There are several methods you can use to access and use Tachyons for your webpage. All of them are listed on the tachyons.io webpage. On my first attempt I used the following commands in my bash to get the components needed for use. 
	Git clone git@github.com:tachyons-css/tachyons.git
	Cd tachyons
	Sudo apt-get install npm
	 Sudo npm install -g browser-sync
Upon running into configuration errors, I decided to go with a different method and just reference the link in my html file. The link is as follows.
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tachyons@4.8.0/css/tachyons.min.css"/>
From here it was simple to just add css to my webpage based on my needs. You can view my code and experimentation at the following link.

I enjoyed using Tachyons for this exploration and will more than likely continue to use it in future development.
